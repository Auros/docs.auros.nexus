### AudioLink Toggle (Poiyomi)

:::warning
Check to make sure if your shaders have an Animate Property option (like Poiyomi).
Otherwise, the property might not animate after your shaders lock.
:::

<ReactPlayer control url={'/video/flare/example-toggle-audiolink.mp4'} />

---

### Disable PhysBones (GameObject)

<ReactPlayer control url={'/video/flare/example-toggle-disable-physbone-gameobject.mp4'} />

---

### Disable PhysBones (Component)
If your setup requires you to have the GameObject enabled (for... some reason),
you can target the enabled property on the specific component. This works for any
Renderer and Behaviour based Component.

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-toggle-disable-physbone-component.mp4'} />

## Radials

### Minimum Brightness Slider

:::warning
Check to make sure if your shaders have an Animate Property option (like Poiyomi).
Otherwise, the property might not animate after your shaders lock.
:::

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-radial-brightness.mp4'} />

---

### Minimum Brightness Slider (Override)

:::warning
Check to make sure if your shaders have an Animate Property option (like Poiyomi).
Otherwise, the property might not animate after your shaders lock.
:::

If you don't want to rely on the Editor value of the material, you can override the value.

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-radial-brightness-override.mp4'} />

---

### Breast Slider (Exclusive)

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-radial-breasts-exclusive.mp4'} />

---

### Breast Slider (Inclusive)
Some models have conventions for the name of blendshapes like the breasts that outfit creators follow,
so they can be easier to animate in bulk. You can use the `Avatar` Selection Mode to animate all values that match
the breast blendshape.

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-radial-breasts-inclusive.mp4'} />

### Scale Transform

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-radial-scale.mp4'} />

## PhysBones

### Grab Hair Effect

<ReactPlayer controls url={'/video/flare/example-physbone-stretch.mp4'} />
