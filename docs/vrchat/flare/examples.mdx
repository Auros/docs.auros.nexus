Renderer and Behaviour based Component.

### Minimum Brightness Slider

### Minimum Brightness Slider (Override)

### Breast Slider (Exclusive)

### Breast Slider (Inclusive)
Some models have conventions for the name of blendshapes like the breasts that outfit creators follow,
so they can be easier to animate in bulk. You can use the `Avatar` Selection Mode to animate all values that match
the breast blendshape.
